Isometric VR Map of Northern Ireland App
----------------------

### Overview

I've always thought that there could be a better way to design an experience that would utilise VR to allow users to immerse themselves in a countries landmarks using VR.

This innovative application will allow users to get an in-depth 360° look at Northern Ireland's popular landmarks such as the Giants Causeway or the Titanic Quarter with interactive isometric designs of these famous landmarks, not only will you be able to see the landmarks in detail but the app would all provide information on the landmark's such as it's history, location and links to any respective websites and information on fees such as tickets and entry fees.

This would hopefully have compatiblity with the latest vr headsets for phones such as the Google Cardboard but the focus would be on making it work with the majority of mobile devices.

As this is a big challenge for me I think I would be focusing on mobile only.

I would like to have atleast one physical 3D Model of one of the landmarks along with pinted items such as stickers, shirts, badges with the project logo, social media would also me a huge part of it, I think it would be good to try and get in contact with Tourist NI or similar organisations for advice.

I truly think that this is a really good idea but also very difficult however the challenge of building it would teach me many new skills.


### Pros

+ This provides a new challenge for me as the only app I have developed in the past was the weatherapp.

+ The possibility to learn new software such as Unity and improve my javascript and 3D Modelling skills.

+ If I choose to create the models in Illustrator I have a lot of experience with this software so it should make the process smoother, ive also used both Blender and Maya in the past.

### Cons

- I have little to no experience working with VR so it is a big challenge but I think with the innovations we are seeing in VR it would be worth it. 

- I’ve never used Unity so I have toe learn an entirely new program, fortunately there are a lot of tutorials out there.

- As it is partly an educational app ill need to thoroughly check that my information is correct.

### How might it be built?

The project will definitely be a mobile application. I think I would build it using using Unity with some HTML, CSS and JavaScript mixed in with the models beign created in Illustrator. These could then be imported into Unity which would be the biggest challenge as ive never used it before but I really want to challenge myself, so I intend to follow the various tutorials that are online. Even if I wasn't unable to create the application I would create a video in After Effects showcasing how it would work.

### Who’s it for?

The target market for this project is:

1. Adults: The main target demographic would be adults as they would generally be the largest percentage who could afford to travel around Northern Ireland.

2. Teen: Possibilty that the app could be used in schools as research material but VR is still a cool new technology so I think just out of general interest and the use of interactive 3D Models makes it more appealing than say Google Maps to the younger generation.

3. Elderly: I think a small percentage of the elderly would use the app, there has been a growth in social media/internet usage by people aged 65+ years of age. 

This information is based on my own thoughts I feel like I would need to conduct some sort of user research.

### What’s the business model?

I think the service would be free as it's educational and especially for tourists I think it would be more advantages for it to be accessible so that newcomers are put off.

A History of Jazz in Carrickfergus
----------------------------------

### Overview

I’ve always loved jazz. The music of Miles Davis – in particular his electric period – has always captivated me.

Most gravitate towards the mainstream melodies of ‘Kind of Blue’, but give me the electric extremities of ‘Bitches Brew’ any day! (Teo Macero is shockingly overlooked, but – trust me – he was, truly, the original dark magus.)

The Carrickfergus jazz scene has been sadly neglected in recent years, however, it is a little known fact that Davis performed there in 1974 (who knew?). I believe this little known fact needs to be celebrated.

Very few people know it, but a flurry of jazzmen are holed up in Carrickfergus and I’m determined to shine a spotlight on these brave souls.

This information-driven iOS app will utilise a number of data visualisation techniques to tell the story of Miles’ little-known Carrickfergus excursion.

I particularly like Nicholas Felton’s work and I hope to learn from him by [studying his methods][B01]. I believe I can use a similar data visualisation technique to amplify this little-known story.

I anticipate that this will be a native app, designed for Apple’s new iPhone X. (I just love that notch!) This project will give me an opportunity to learn about designing native apps for iOS with a specific focus on audio (something I’m new to).


### Pros

+ I’ve never built an iOS app using Swift, this would be a great opportunity to learn. (I might be mistaken, but I’ve heard Swift is the future…?)

+ The old Carrickfergus jazzmen (and woman!) deserve their moment in the spotlight and this would be it.

+ Carrickfergus has a sizable jazz-loving population, this app would satisfy their needs.


### Cons

+ I’ve never used Swift, it might be difficult.

+ I might need to learn some audio editing and I have no experience of this (but I’ll give it a go!).

+ This might be a somewhat niche product. Jazzmen + Carrickfergus = Small Audience…?


### How might it be built?

I think this project would be best served by a native mobile application, but I may be wrong.

I’m new to this – I’ve never built an app before – so I’m going to focus on iOS. (If my app were successful, however, I’d happily build an Android version.) Apple offer some great tutorials on getting started with Swift – I think they’re called [Playgrounds][B02] on the iPad – and I’m looking forward to learning something new.


### Who’s it for?

The target market for this project is quite niche: jazzmen (the 99%), and one – improvisatory – woman (the one per cent) and, as such, their needs can be quite clearly defined through user research.

My Dad has an extensive free-jazz cassette collection, I think the world is now ready to hear it! I’m looking forward to sharing it with Carrickfergus’s jazzmen and jazzwoman and, I hope, opening up the ears of an audience that is further afield.


### What’s the business model?

There isn’t really a business model for this project. I see this as a much-needed contribution to society.

The world needs to learn about the history of jazz in Carrickfergus and this project is my way of satisfying that pressing educational need. There may be an opportunity to monetise this iOS app, but that isn’t my goal. Of course I’ll research business models, but I feel strongly that this project should be – as Chris Anderson explores – [free][B03].

A Beginner’s Guide to Pinhole Photography
----------------------------------------

We live in an age that is obsessively focused on the over-engineered fictions of Instagram, shared without thought it seems on the latest social network that has fleetingly caught the imagination.

Moments ‘captured’ that, in reality, are moments ‘crafted’.

It seems like a forgotten past, but once there was a time when each and every photograph, each and every slice of time was weighed up before film was exposed to light. Film, expensive, was savoured and cherished; used with care. Sadly, it seems that time has passed.

This ebook – delivered as a PDF, ePub and .mobi – is intended to introduce digital photographers (and other novices to film) to the wonderful world of [pinhole photography][C01], equipping them with the knowledge they need to get started exposing film to light.

A lavishly illustrated ebook, *A Beginner’s Guide to Pinhole Photography*, is intended as a primer, covering everything you need to know to get started with pinhole photography.

In addition to the book itself, I propose to create a supporting web site that will act as a showcase for the book, but which will also feature links to all the materials you need to get started as a pinhole photographer.

When sensors are, year-on-year, accelerating, *A Beginner’s Guide to Pinhole Photography* affords an opportunity to step outside of the digital realm and experience photography – once again – as a resolutely analogue medium.


### Pros

+ I’m an avid pinhole photographer and this project gives me a chance to promote my hobby.

+ The project – which will be delivered in PDF, ePub and .mobi formats - gives me a fantastic opportunity to learn a wealth of new skills.

+ This project could potentially earn me some much-needed money. (I could perhaps launch it as a [Kickstarter][C02] or use Ulster University’s new crowdfunding platform?)


### Cons

+ I have no experience writing tutorials so I’ll need to learn about structuring educational information.

+ I’ve never created an ebook before, but I am determined to learn.

+ To do the project justice I’ll need to buy some ISBN numbers (which is another aspect I’ll need to learn).


### How might it be built?

My intention is to create PDF, ePub and .mobi formats of *A Beginner’s Guide to Pinhole Photography*. This is going to be a substantial task and will involve a great deal of new skills acquisition.

I have some experience of creating PDFs, but I’ve never created an ePub or .mobi book before. This will be a challenge. I intend, however, to use Mark and Emma Boulton’s [Creating eBooks][C03], which I’ve been told is a great overview.


### Who’s it for?

*A Beginner’s Guide to Pinhole Photography* is intended for anyone that is interested in photography.

The audience is potentially quite large, which is why I believe there might be an opportunity to launch the project as a Kickstarter.

Once I’ve undertaken some market research, I’ll have a clear idea of the demand for the product. At that point I will decide if a Kickstarter, or other crowdfunding campaign, is worth exploring as a part of my Major Project.


### What’s the business model?

This project would lend itself well to a crowdfunding campaign, which would teach me something new. I intend to undertake some market research to see if there is demand for the ebook.

If there is enough interest I plan on launching a Kickstarter as a part of the project. This would round the project out nicely and ensure it’s a considerable challenge.

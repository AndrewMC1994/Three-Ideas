Isometric VR Map of Northern Ireland App
----------------------

### Overview

I've always thought that there could be a better way to design an experience that would utilise VR to allow users to immerse themselves in the landmarks and culture of a country or location.

This innovative application will allow users to get an in-depth 360° look at Northern Ireland's popular landmarks such as the Giants Causeway or the Titanic Quarter with interactive isometric designs of these famous landmarks, not only will you be able to see the landmarks in detail but the app would also provide information on the landmark's such as it's history, location and links to any respective websites and information on fees such as tickets and entry fees.

This would hopefully have compatiblity with the latest vr headsets for phones such as the Google Cardboard but the focus would be on making it work with the majority of mobile devices.

As this is a big challenge for me I think I would be focusing on mobile only.

I would like to have atleast one physical 3D Model of one of the landmarks along with printed items such as stickers, shirts, badges with the project logo, social media would also me a huge part of it, I think it would be good to try and get in contact with Tourist NI or similar organisations if the the project proved successful.

I think that this is a really good idea and also very challenging so it's a great opportunity to learn a new set of skills and techniques that I think would benefit me in my future endeavors.

### Pros

+ This provides a new challenge for me as the only app I have developed in the past was the weatherapp.

+ The possibility to learn new software such as Unity and improve my javascript and 3D Modelling skills.

+ If I choose to create the models in Illustrator I have a lot of experience with this software so it should make the process smoother, ive also used both Blender and Maya in the past.

### Cons

- I have little to no experience working with VR so it is a big challenge but I think with the innovations we are seeing in VR it would be worth it. 

- I’ve never used Unity so I have to learn an entirely new program, fortunately there are a lot of tutorials out there.

- As it is partly an educational app ill need to thoroughly check that my information is correct.

### How might it be built?

The project will definitely be a mobile application. I would build it using using Unity with some HTML, CSS and JavaScript used for creating some of the scripts with the models being created in Illustrator or Blender. These could then be imported into Unity which would be the biggest challenge as ive never used it before but I really want to challenge myself, so I intend to follow the various tutorials that are online, like this [one](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-a-vr-app-with-zero-experience-927438e2dede).

### Who’s it for?

The target market for this project is:

1. Adults: The main target demographic would be adults as they would generally be the largest percentage who could afford to travel to/around Northern Ireland and thus would use the app to learn about the location.

2. Teen: Possibilty that the app could be used in schools as research material but VR is still a cool new technology so I think just out of general interest and the use of interactive 3D Models makes it more appealing than say Google Maps to the younger generation.

This information is based on my own thoughts I feel like I would need to conduct some sort of user research.

### What’s the business model?

I think the service would be free as it's educational and especially for tourists I think it would be beneficial for it to be accessible so that newcomers arn't put off by having the pay a fee.

3D Printed Figures
----------------------------------

### Overview

I've always wanted to work with 3D printing and my final year project seems like a great opportunity.

I think an interesting approach would be creating a line of small 3d figurines... these figures would also have there own custom box designs similar to [funko pop figurines.](https://popvinylfaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Custom-pop-box.jpg)

I think it would also be beneficial to have a companion app or website though this would entirely depend on how long it would take to get the models designed and printed, this requires further research.

I intend to keep the designs fairly simple in shape as this means they would be cheaper and easier to produce, I think I can have some articulation by designing certain parts separately and printing them individually. I've look at some models on Behance that where created using 3D printing, I especially like this one by [Alessandro Randi.](https://www.behance.net/gallery/20509195/Steve-Zissou)

This project will give me an opportunity to learn about designing a 3D model for print, I will also get to improve my knowledge in programs such as Illustrator and possibly Blender/Maya.

### Pros

+ I get to use a mixture of software which means that I get to improve my knowledge in each of these programs.

+ The opportunity to work with 3D printing and the challenges that might come with it.

+ I know someone who makes 3d figurines which would save me a lot of time if they where happy to get involved.

### Cons

- I Don't know how much it would cost, this requires further research, possibly kickstarter?

- I may not have enough experience to create the 3D Models, this part may need outsourced?

- This might be a somewhat niche product, I might do a limited Edition run of these figures to survey interest.

### How might it be built?

I would initially create some sketches for each character and would bring these in Illustrator to create detailed 2D Illustrations, I would then either outsouce or create the 3D models myself using Blender or Illustrator. I intend to create a [template](https://i.etsystatic.com/6241687/r/il/51541a/732012401/il_570xN.732012401_62o7.jpg) for the box using photoshop/illustrator, this means I can print the box using a sturdy material and makes the process of creating the box simple and straightforward.

The difficult part would be getting the figures printed, I know someone who makes figurines so that could be a possible solution and after doing some research there seems to be quite a few locations in Belfast to get models [printed](https://www.fablabbelfast.org/) so it definitely seems like a plausable project.

### Who’s it for?

1. Children: I would aim to create something that has a fun and appealing design aesthetic aiming the product mainly at children.

I think I would have to conduct more user research to find who the wider audience might be while i'm aiming the product at children depending on the overall design it might reach a wider audience.

### What’s the business model?

I would have to do some user research and find out if there is enough interest but if there was this would be a good opportunity to launch a Kickstarter project for possible funding and I could also possibly have a run of limited edition figures.

Project Plan and Marketing Website
----------------------------------------

When planning a project it always seem like you have to use a multitiude of apps and websites to fully plan and market your idea.

This innovative idea will allow users to not only plan there project from start to finish but it will allow them to add detailed information, dates, budgets, timeframe, images and importantly it will allows users to market there project through social media all in one place.

This web site will be built using web standards (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and would include features such as the ability to login / signup and would allow multiple users to contribute to a project, this requires extensive research into how these systems would work as I haven't created something like this before.

I plan to include some data visualisation charts and diagrams which would be an extremely useful feature and creating some kind of dashboard for each user where they can view these statistics would be a great feature to have aswell. Including some micro-interactions and css animations would also be an imporant element to include to help the overall appeal of the website.

In addition to the website itself, I would like to have some items created as marketing for the website such as stickers, shirts and badges with the project logo.

### Pros

+ I will be able to further practice and improve my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

+ This is a website that I would use myself and think especially students would find it to be a very useful tool.

+ Learning to build and create so many different features will be extremely useful for any future projects.

### Cons

- I really need to consider what features to include on both the project and marketing sides so that I don't exclude any critical features.

- My Javascript knowledge needs work, this would be a good learning opportunity.

- I've never created a website of this complexity before but I will learn.

### How might it be built?

This web site will be built using web standards ( HTML, CSS and JavaScript).

I have a good understanding of HTML and CSS and would like use CSS Grid Layout as I was a big fan of it when I utilized it creating my portfolio website however my Javascript skills are not up to par so I feel like this is a good opportunity for me to improve in that area.

Certain features such as the sign/up login and data visualisation charts require further research as I don't have past experience creating them but it will be a great learning opportunity.

I think this is a good opporunity to challenge myself, so I intend to learn pursue new web design techniques but I would also like to include my love of graphic design and create some illustrations for the website which I could hopefully animate to give the website some interactive visuals.

### Who’s it for?

1. Adults: This website would be excellent for any adults who are working on a big project whether it's for themselves or for there business, the ability to both plan a project and market it on one website is a big timesaver.

2. Students: Thinking of myself and students who are working on big projects for university or college, a project and marketing website like this would have been extremely useful for final year but from my research I didn't find anything which had what I wanted without having to use multiple apps and websites.

### What’s the business model?

The website I think initially would be free to use and sign up but with the possibility of a membership subcription service that allows users to use more advanced features.

I think looking at websites with a similar business models might be a good research opportunity.

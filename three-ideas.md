Isometric VR Map of Northern Ireland App
----------------------

### Overview

I've always thought that there could be a better way to design an experience that would utilise VR to allow users to immerse themselves in a countries landmarks.

This innovative application will allow users to get an in-depth 360° look at Northern Ireland's popular landmarks such as the Giants Causeway or the Titanic Quarter with interactive isometric designs of these famous landmarks, not only will you be able to see the landmarks in detail but the app would all provide information on the landmark's such as it's history, location and links to any respective websites and information on fees such as tickets and entry fees.

This would hopefully have compatiblity with the latest vr headsets for phones such as the Google Cardboard but the focus would be on making it work with the majority of mobile devices.

As this is a big challenge for me I think I would be focusing on mobile only.

I would like to have atleast one physical 3D Model of one of the landmarks along with pinted items such as stickers, shirts, badges with the project logo, social media would also me a huge part of it, I think it would be good to try and get in contact with Tourist NI or similar organisations for advice.

I think that this is a really good idea but also very difficult but the challenge of building it would teach me many new skills and techniques that I think its worth it.

### Pros

+ This provides a new challenge for me as the only app I have developed in the past was the weatherapp.

+ The possibility to learn new software such as Unity and improve my javascript and 3D Modelling skills.

+ If I choose to create the models in Illustrator I have a lot of experience with this software so it should make the process smoother, ive also used both Blender and Maya in the past.

### Cons

- I have little to no experience working with VR so it is a big challenge but I think with the innovations we are seeing in VR it would be worth it. 

- I’ve never used Unity so I have toe learn an entirely new program, fortunately there are a lot of tutorials out there.

- As it is partly an educational app ill need to thoroughly check that my information is correct.

### How might it be built?

The project will definitely be a mobile application. I think I would build it using using Unity with some HTML, CSS and JavaScript mixed in with the models being created in Illustrator. These could then be imported into Unity which would be the biggest challenge as ive never used it before but I really want to challenge myself, so I intend to follow the various tutorials that are online, like this [one](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-a-vr-app-with-zero-experience-927438e2dede). Even if I wasn't unable to create the application I would create a video in After Effects showcasing how it would work.

### Who’s it for?

The target market for this project is:

1. Adults: The main target demographic would be adults as they would generally be the largest percentage who could afford to travel around Northern Ireland.

2. Teen: Possibilty that the app could be used in schools as research material but VR is still a cool new technology so I think just out of general interest and the use of interactive 3D Models makes it more appealing than say Google Maps to the younger generation.

3. Elderly: I think a small percentage of the elderly would use the app, there has been a growth in social media/internet usage by people aged 65+ years of age. 

This information is based on my own thoughts I feel like I would need to conduct some sort of user research.

### What’s the business model?

I think the service would be free as it's educational and especially for tourists I think it would be beneficial for it to be accessible so that newcomers arn't put off by having the pay a fee.

Interaction Design Educational 3D Printed Figures
----------------------------------

### Overview

I've always wanted to work with 3D printing and my final year project seems like a great opportunity.

I think an interesting approach would be creating a 3D figurine for each subject that relates to Interaction Design for example web design, graphic design, photography, animation etc.. these figures would also have there own custom box designs similar to [funko pop figurines.](https://popvinylfaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Custom-pop-box.jpg) The figures are intended to introduce children and young teenagers into the world of interaction design, essentially trying to engage there interest in these subjects at a young age.

I think it would also be beneficial to have a companion app or website though this would entirely depend on how long it would take to get the models designed and printed, this requires further research.

I intend to keep the designs fairly simple in shape as this means they would be cheaper and easier to produce, I think I can have some articulation by designing certain parts sepertely and printing them individually. I've look at some models on Behance that where created using 3D printing, I especially like this one by [Alejandro Giraldo.](https://www.behance.net/gallery/26953933/The-Captain-3D-printed-Toy)

This project will give me an opportunity to learn about designing a 3D model for print, I will also get to improve my knowledge in programs such as Illustrator and possibly Blender/Maya.

### Pros

+ I get to use a mixture of software which means that I get to improve my knowledge in each of these programs.

+ The old Carrickfergus jazzmen (and woman!) deserve their moment in the spotlight and this would be it.

+ I know someone who makes 3d figurines which would save me a lot of time if they where happy to get involved.


### Cons

- I Don't know how much it would cost, this requires further research, possibly kickstarter?

- I may not have enough experience to create the 3D Models, this part may need outsourced?

- This might be a somewhat niche product, are kids interested in these subjects at such a young age?


### How might it be built?

I would initially create some sketches for each character and would bring these in Illustrator to create detailed 2D Illustrations, I would then either outsouce or create the 3D models myself using Blender. I intend to create the box

The difficult part would be getting them printed physically, I do know someone who makes figurines so that could be a possible solution and also after doing some research there seems to be quite a few locations in Belfast to get models [printed.](https://www.fablabbelfast.org/)

### Who’s it for?

1. Children: As this is an educationl toy the main demographic is children, my hope would be that this would be a fun but also an educational tool.

2. Young Teenagers: I don't think it's necessarily restricted to children, even young teenagers going through school could find these educational.

### What’s the business model?

I would have to do some user research and find out if there is enough interest but if there was this would be a good opportunity to launch a Kickstarter project for possible funding.

Animation?
----------------------------------------

We live in an age that is obsessively focused on the over-engineered fictions of Instagram, shared without thought it seems on the latest social network that has fleetingly caught the imagination.

Moments ‘captured’ that, in reality, are moments ‘crafted’.

It seems like a forgotten past, but once there was a time when each and every photograph, each and every slice of time was weighed up before film was exposed to light. Film, expensive, was savoured and cherished; used with care. Sadly, it seems that time has passed.

This ebook – delivered as a PDF, ePub and .mobi – is intended to introduce digital photographers (and other novices to film) to the wonderful world of [pinhole photography][C01], equipping them with the knowledge they need to get started exposing film to light.

A lavishly illustrated ebook, *A Beginner’s Guide to Pinhole Photography*, is intended as a primer, covering everything you need to know to get started with pinhole photography.

In addition to the book itself, I propose to create a supporting web site that will act as a showcase for the book, but which will also feature links to all the materials you need to get started as a pinhole photographer.

When sensors are, year-on-year, accelerating, *A Beginner’s Guide to Pinhole Photography* affords an opportunity to step outside of the digital realm and experience photography – once again – as a resolutely analogue medium.


### Pros

+ I’m an avid pinhole photographer and this project gives me a chance to promote my hobby.

+ The project – which will be delivered in PDF, ePub and .mobi formats - gives me a fantastic opportunity to learn a wealth of new skills.

+ This project could potentially earn me some much-needed money. (I could perhaps launch it as a [Kickstarter][C02] or use Ulster University’s new crowdfunding platform?)


### Cons

+ I have no experience writing tutorials so I’ll need to learn about structuring educational information.

+ I’ve never created an ebook before, but I am determined to learn.

+ To do the project justice I’ll need to buy some ISBN numbers (which is another aspect I’ll need to learn).


### How might it be built?

My intention is to create PDF, ePub and .mobi formats of *A Beginner’s Guide to Pinhole Photography*. This is going to be a substantial task and will involve a great deal of new skills acquisition.

I have some experience of creating PDFs, but I’ve never created an ePub or .mobi book before. This will be a challenge. I intend, however, to use Mark and Emma Boulton’s [Creating eBooks][C03], which I’ve been told is a great overview.


### Who’s it for?

*A Beginner’s Guide to Pinhole Photography* is intended for anyone that is interested in photography.

The audience is potentially quite large, which is why I believe there might be an opportunity to launch the project as a Kickstarter.

Once I’ve undertaken some market research, I’ll have a clear idea of the demand for the product. At that point I will decide if a Kickstarter, or other crowdfunding campaign, is worth exploring as a part of my Major Project.


### What’s the business model?

This project would lend itself well to a crowdfunding campaign, which would teach me something new. I intend to undertake some market research to see if there is demand for the ebook.

If there is enough interest I plan on launching a Kickstarter as a part of the project. This would round the project out nicely and ensure it’s a considerable challenge.
